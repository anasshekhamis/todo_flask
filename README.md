# Todo List in Flask
Simple Todo list API using Flask framework.

## Installing
* Configuration file can be found in the "todo" package module (under 'config.py'), which contains the database configuration. It's preferable to use an "env" file to store the environment variables.
* Run "db.py" script after configuring the DB connection to create the required tables (this application is using MySQL as a DBMS, but you can configure it to run whatever you like).
* Run "runserver.py" script to start the application.
* Application requirements are in "requirements.txt" to be installed using "pip" (Python Package Manager).
